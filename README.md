# Code-201-Reading-Notes
# summary:-

* A web page consists of elements written in HTML that form the basis of the page.
* Special operations are written by enclosing them in parentheses <>

## The web page consists of :
<html>
<head> 
<title> the title </title>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>

* At this point, we have covered the main
tags that fit nicely into groups and
sections.
In this chapter, we will focus on some helpful topics that are
not easily grouped together. You will learn about:
The different versions of H ●● TML and how to indicate which
version you are using
●● How to add comments to your code
●● Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on
any element, including the class and id attributes
●● Elements that are used to group together parts of the page
where no other element is suitable
●● How to embed a page within a page using iframes
●● How to add information about the web page using the
<meta> element
●● Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright
symbols
* to type comment hi HTML we use <!-- -->
* Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.
For example, you might have
some paragraphs of text that
contain information that is more
important than others and want
to distinguish these elements, or
you might want to differentiate
between links that point to other
pages on your own site and links
that point to external sites.

* Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.
