CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.

You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.

You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.

It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.

Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
