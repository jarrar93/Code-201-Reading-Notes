# Code-201-Reading-Notes
# summary:-

* A web page consists of elements written in HTML that form the basis of the page.
* Special operations are written by enclosing them in parentheses <>

## The web page consists of :
<html>
<head> 
<title> the title </title>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>

* At this point, we have covered the main
tags that fit nicely into groups and
sections.
In this chapter, we will focus on some helpful topics that are
not easily grouped together. You will learn about:
The different versions of H ●● TML and how to indicate which
version you are using
●● How to add comments to your code
●● Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on
any element, including the class and id attributes
●● Elements that are used to group together parts of the page
where no other element is suitable
●● How to embed a page within a page using iframes
●● How to add information about the web page using the
<meta> element
●● Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright
symbols
* to type comment hi HTML we use <!-- -->
* Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements
as being different from the
other elements on the page.
For example,you might have
some paragraphs of text that
contain information that is more
important than others and want
to distinguish these elements, or
you might want to differentiate
between links that point to other
pages on your own site and links
that point to external sites.

* Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.

# What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve :

* Gordon bought a tennis racquet several years ago; now he wants to
purchase one from your site for his girlfriend.

Moll y has read about your new doggy daycare service in the press and
wants to find out whether it would be suitable for her to use.

Jasper had a bad experience staying in a hotel when visiting Sydney,
Australia, and wants to make a complaint.

Ayo hopes to study architecture and wants to learn more about a new
course that is being offered.

Ivy is a picture editor and wants to look at a photographer's site to see
examples of his work before deciding whether to commission him.

HOW javascript makes web bages more interactive :
** 1. ACCESS CONTENT ** You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:

Select the text inside all of the elements on a page
Select any elements that have a c1ass attribute with a value of note
Find out what was entered into atext input whose id attribute has avalue of emai1
2. MODIFY CONTENT You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:

Add a paragraph of text after the first element
Change the value of c 1 assattributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
Change the size or position of an element
3. PROGRAM RULES You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:

A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform acalculation, and display repayments.
An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).
4. REACT TO EVENTS You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:

A button is pressed
A link is clicked (or tapped) on
A cursor hovers over an element
Information is added to a form
An interval of time has passed
A web page has finished loading
What is a script and how do I creat one :
A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
