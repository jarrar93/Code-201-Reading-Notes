* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
* Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
* Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.
* Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
