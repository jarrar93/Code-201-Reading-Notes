* Tell Me About Yourself
* Why Should We Hire You?
* What Is Your Greatest Strength?
* What Is Your Greatest Weakness?
* Why Do You Want To Work For Us?
* Why Did You Leave Your Last Job?
* What Is Your Greatest Accomplishment?
* Describe A Difficult Work Situation And What * You Did To Overcome It
* Where Do You See Yourself In 5 Years?
* Do You Have Any Questions For Me (the interviewer)?

If you were literally fired from your last job, you’re going to have to own up to it and show what you learned from the experience and what measures you have taken to address the reasons you were let go.
 

 If you were let go, be honest and explain the situation and own it. Explain what you learned from the experience, because the interviewer knows you’re human, you make mistakes, and just wants to see that you were able to do something about it

Don’t fall into the trap of thinking your accomplishment is “too small”. The fact is, relating a small accomplishment that is inline with “what the company values” can be more powerful than an unrelated accomplishment. (Remember: “It’s not about you, It’s about them.”)

This is one of those pesky behavioral interview questions and is one of the most common. You need to have a “success story” ready to go for this. Relate a story where you dealt with a problem successfully. The key here is to pick a success story that shows you exhibiting the qualities/skills required at the job and company you are interviewing for.
