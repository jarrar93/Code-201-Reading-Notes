 (Links to an external site.)Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

 (Links to an external site.)Links are created using the  element. Users can click on anything between the opening  tag and the closing  tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute

 # Summary
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/cssi-2.3-functions/master/images/functions.png)
LINKS

Links are created using the < a > element.

The < a > element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the “to” field.

You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

## Chapter 15

Layout

In this chapter we are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.

This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be different to designing for other mediums (such as print).

In this chapter we will:

Explore different ways to position elements using normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.

Discover how various devices have different screen sizes and resolution, and how this affects the design process.

Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts, and how they are created.

Find out how designers use grids to make their page designs look more professional.

Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

Building Blocks

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.
Block-level elements

start on a new line

## Examples include:

< h1 > < p > < ul > < li >
Inline elements

flow in between surrounding text

Examples include:

< img > < b > < i >

Functions Methods and Objects
Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.

Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.

An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.

In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.

Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.

JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).

6 Reasons for Pair Programming
How does pair programming work?
pair programming commonly involves two roles:
The Driver: is the programmer who is typing
The Navigator: uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer
Why pair program?
Greater efficiency

Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product). So, in the long-run, it’s often actually more efficient than two people working on separate features.
Engaged collaboration

When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help. Ultimately, this boosts overall confidence.
Learning from fellow students

the developers in a pairing have different skill sets. If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area.
Social skills

Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.
Job interview readiness

the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.
Work environment readiness

Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
