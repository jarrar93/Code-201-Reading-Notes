## Structural markup:
 the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs
## Semantic markup:
 which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on.

The< blockquote > element is
used for longer quotes that take
up an entire paragraph. Note
how the < p> element is still
used inside the < blockquote>
element.
